# Predicting Mental Health Challenges in Tech
This was my team’s final project submission for the UBC Sauder School of Business Master of Business Analytics BAIT 509 course. 

# Description
The central business question of our project was to help tech companies identify employees at risk of mental health challenges and propose strategies for supporting their mental well-being effectively. To do so, we designed a model that, given a set of data about tech employees, can predict if an employee has had experience with mental health challenges, measured by whether they have sought mental health treatment before.

# Data
The dataset used in this project is from a 2014 survey measuring attitudes towards mental health in the tech workplace (Open Sourcing Mental Illness, 2017). The dataset has twenty-seven columns containing information on each respondent’s demographics, workplace details, as well as their experience around and attitudes towards mental health. 

# Files Included
* _mind_matters_JUP.ipynb_ is a Jupyter notebook detailing our analysis, methods, and results
* _mind_matters_report.pdf_ explains the motivations, data cleaning and analysis, as well as a detailed description of all results and plots
